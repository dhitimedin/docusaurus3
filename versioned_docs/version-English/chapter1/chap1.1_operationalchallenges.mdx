# 1.1. Mini-grid Overview and Operational Challenges

Renewables-based mini-grids offer an innovative and compelling solution for last-mile electricity delivery. They facilitate the injection of much-needed private capital to accelerate progress in the electricity access space; at the same time, their tight focus on local catchment areas enables them to offer high quality of service to customers, and to support the flourishing of lives and livelihoods in the local community.
However, mini-grid companies face many challenges in creating a sustainable business, including:
* Remote and dispersed sites, with corresponding demands on personnel mobility and communications
* Low-income customers, who face restrictions in their levels of energy consumption
* Lack of labour force training, including business management skills and technical experience

As the mini-grid sector matures, robust streamlining of management and on-ground operations is needed. The Mini-grid Communications, Operations, and Management Suite (MCOMS) fulfils this need through a comprehensive IT-based solution, which will help to unleash mini-gridsâ€™ potential in delivering high-quality electricity and responsive customer service around the world.
